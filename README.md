## Overview

In this repository, you will find YETI's historical scouting data collected during past events. The data includes information about teams, matches, and various performance metrics. Metrics collected may vary from year-to-year.

## Contents

The repository is organized into yearly folders, and further organized by event. The structure of the files for each event may change from year-to-year, but will likely be standardized in the future.

We'll work to add documentation (i.e., data dictionaries) for all fields in the coming weeks.
