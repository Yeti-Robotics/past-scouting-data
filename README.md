# Past Scouting Data

This repository contains our past scouting data.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find YETI's historical scouting data collected during past events. The data includes information about teams, matches, and various performance metrics. Metrics collected may vary from year-to-year

## Contents

The repository is organized into yearly folders, and further organized by event. Each event folder contains the following files:

- `{event_name}-team-data.json`: Aggregated metrics for each team at the event. Metrics may vary from year-to-year.
- `{event_name}-stand-forms.json`: Individual match data collected by our scouting team. Each object in the array represents a team's performance in a single match. Stand forms reflect the current year's game and scoring system.
